# React Image Resizer app - Brief walkaround

- User can resize images to custom width x height . Values are entered in the frontend form.
- Only .jpg images are allowed for upload.
- User can select images from starter images already available in the application OR upload new images.
- **✅ No page refresh on image upload. User may need to scroll to find the latest uploaded image**
- ✅ Resized image url is available once the resizing is completed. Clicking it opens the resized image in a new browser tab.
